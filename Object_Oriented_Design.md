# Object Oriented Design Concepts

## Clean code principles:
- Give meaniful names to variables, functions, classes and other entities.
- Create functions that are small and do a single thing
-

## Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

## Keep It Simple Stupid

## Separation of Concerns
Each module should address a separate concern. Modularity and SoC is achieved by creating well-encapsulated classes that have well-defined interfaces. SoC helps matinenace and code reuse.

## Maximize cohesion
Cohesion is how strongly related and focused the various responsibilities of a module are.  High cohesion results in better understanding, maintaining, and reusing components.

Cohesion is increased if:
- Functionalities in a class have much in common.
- Methods carry out small number of related activies by avoiding unrelated sets of data.
- Related methods are in the same source file or closely grouped together.

## Minimize Coupling
Coupling is how much a module depends on other modules, a measure of how closely connected two modules are.

Tightly coupled modules have disadvantages:
- Change in one module may break another module.
- Change in one module has a ripple effect of changes in other modules.
- Reusability decreases and dependency increases.
- Assembly of modules require more effort and time.
