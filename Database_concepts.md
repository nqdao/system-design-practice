# Database design

# ACID properties

## Atomicity

## Consistency

## Isolation

## Durability

# CAP Theorem

## Consistency
Any read request will return the most recent write

## Availability


## Partition Tolerance

# SQL vs NoSQL (i.e. Relational vs. Non-relational Database)
- SQL is strong consistency. Enforce ACID
- NoSQL is eventual consistency. There maybe delay between write and read the latest update.

# Sharding

# Consistent Hashing
